    <h1>Thank You!</h1>

    <blockquote>
	<p>
	This project has been alive for many years. Countless people have provided
	feedback that have improved hypermail.
	</p>
      
    <p>Thanks to <a href=
    "https://tomgruber.org/innovation/innovation-hypermail">
	Tom Gruber</a>, who originally designed and developed Hypermail
	in Common Lisp, for the basis of a <strong>GREAT</strong>
	tool.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks to Kevin Hughes for developing the initial C version of
	Hypermail and assisting in its transition to the hypermail
	project organization. Thanks Kevin!</p>

    <p>Thanks to Kent Landfield for having started the hypermail
	project organization, the first hypermail project web site,
	leading the project 1997 to 2003, and encouraging people to
	contribute their patches and ideas. The few years you spent on
	hypermail really made the project evolve.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks to Darci Chapman for encouraging Kent to incorporate his
	initial "hacks" into the hypermail source code and for the
	initial code clean up.</p>
    
    <p>Many thanks to Daniel Stenberg for all the work he did for
	adding support for MIME attachments and his trio library.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Peter C. McCluskey for his code contributions, for
	having curated hypermail from roughly 2003-2008 as well as
	keeping <a href="https://www.hypermail-project.org/">hypermail project site</a>
	running for so long.</p>

    <p>Thanks to Ashley M. Kirchner for having maintained the original
	CVS server for hypermail and giving us access to the
	repository for transitioning to sourceforge</p>

    <p>The following people should be noted for their work and
	contributions to Hypermail's development(alphabetic by last name or user handle).</p>
