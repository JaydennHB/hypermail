  <h3><a href="#" id="1">1. Why is the License Different
  ?</a></h3>
  <p>Hewlett-Packard (who is now the legal owner of Hypermail,
      since EIT was bought by VeriFone, which was bought by
      Hewlett-Packard) has put it under the GNU license, a widely used
      "free software" license. This means that you can use and modify
      the source code as long as you make your changes publically
      available and do not charge for their use (although, under GNU,
      you can charge for their distribution). More details are
      available at <a href=
		      "http://www.fsf.org/">http://www.fsf.org/</a> and <a href=
									   "http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />
  
  <h3><a href="#" id="2">2. Will hypermail run on my
  system ?</a></h3>
  <p>Hypermail can compile and run as-is on most of the more
  popular UNIX systems today. If you're not sure if hypermail will
  run on your UNIX system, try compiling it and see!</p>
  <p>Hypermail has been reported to work on MacOSX (X.2.6), with
  the advice to use --disable-shared and manually execute make in
  src/pcre.</p>
  <p>People have indeed ported hypermail to DOS, Windows 95, and
      Windows NT (but not Java ...yet). Installation advice for some
      Windows systems is available at <a href=
					 "http://www.hypermail.org/win32.html">win32.html</a>.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />
  
  <h3><a href="#" id="3">3. What Happened to EIT
  ?</a></h3>
  <p>A very old and established government contractor company
      called Electronic Instrumentation and Technology Inc. made legal
      moves to obtain the eit.com domain. Since VeriFone/HP had no
      interest in keeping EIT, they dissolved it completely some months
      ago. This company had a trademark on EIT so the domain name was
      given to them. (Thank you InterNic...)</p>
  <hr class="centered" />
  
  <h3><a href="#" id="4">4. Where in the World is Kevin
  Hughes ?</a></h3>
  <p>Kevin has not dropped off the face of the earth but is
  extremely busy these days as a Hypermedia Engineer at Veo
  Systems.</p>

  <h3><a href="#" id="5">5. What is the latest version of
  Hypermail ?</a></h3>
  <p>The latest stable version of Hypermail is Version 2.1.9. It is
      available from <a href=
			"http://www.hypermail-project.org">http://www.hypermail-project.org</a></p>
  <hr class="centered" />
  
  <h3><a href="#" id="6">6. Where can I get the latest
  version of Hypermail ?</a></h3>
  <p>The latest version of Hypermail is available from the
  Hypermail Development Center at <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/hypermail/">SourceForge</a>
  and/or at</p>
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href=
  "http://www.hypermail-project.org">http://www.hypermail-project.org/</a></p>It
  and past versions are also available via FTP from
  <p style="text-align: center"><a href=
  "ftp://ftp.hypermail.org/hypermail/">ftp://ftp.hypermail.org/hypermail/</a></p>
  <p>The cvs server at <a href=
  "http://cvs.hypermail.org">:pserver:cvs@cvs.hypermail.org:/CVS</a>
  usually has a more recent but less tested version.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />
  <h3><a href="#" id="7">7. How can I split the archives
  into months ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>I have a fat archive that I'd like to split up by month,
  like I see so many others doing. Is there a description somewhere
  of a procedure to follow, or will I just have to think it
  through?</em></p>
  <p>If you are using version 2.1.0 or later and either have gdbm
  or don't do incremental updates, see the <a href=
  "hmrc.html#folder_by_date">folder_by_date</a> option. The simple
  way to use this is to add these to your .hmrc:</p>
  <blockquote>
    folder_by_date="%y%m"<br />
    usegdbm = 1
  </blockquote>and regenerate your archive from its mbox file.
  <p>An older alternative is a set of scripts in a directory named
  <a href="source/archive/">archive/</a> that has tools to do just
  what you want to do.</p>
  <p>If you want index files split by month but don't need to split
  the archive into multiple directories, try adding
  "monthly_index=1" in your config file (usually ~/.hmrc)
  (available in version 2.1). A summary.html file will provide
  links to all the monthly indices. This is probably appropriate
  for archives with a few thousand messages, but for larger
  archives I recommend splitting into multiple directories.</p>
  <p>There's a script at <a href=
  "http://users.netrus.net/troc/perl.html">http://users.netrus.net/troc/perl.html</a>
  called mms (monthly mail splitter) which has also been reported
  useful.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="8">8. How do I change the font on
  the pages ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>What I'd like to do is change the font of the archives
  pages. I tried doing this by adding a &lt;FONT FACE=...&gt; tag
  in the header.hyp file and a &lt;FONT&gt; tag in the footer file,
  but it didn't work. Is there something in the program itself
  that's preventing me from making this change?</em></p>
  <p>Yes and no. Let me guess... You have <strong>hm_usetable =
  1</strong>. The code for tables is not inheriting the FONT values
  and that they need to be set in the &lt;TH..&gt; tags. If tables
  are not used it works as expected.</p>
  <p>To test it put a</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>&lt;FONT SIZE="1"
    FACE="GENEVA,ARIAL,HELVETICA"&gt;</small></strong>
  </blockquote>in the test-index.hyp and test-msg.hyp. In
  test-footer.hyp put
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>&lt;/FONT&gt;</small></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>With <strong>hm_usetable = 1</strong> in the test.rc file,
  then ran "<strong>hypermail -c test.rc -m testmail</strong>" and
  everything between the "menus" was the right FONT but the menus
  were not.</p>
  <p>Then edit the test.rc file and set <strong>hm_usetable =
  0</strong>. Next remove the existing testdir and rerun hypermail
  again. This time the FONT works as expected.</p>
  <p>Is this what is happening to you ? If so the code will need to
  be modified.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="9">9. What is HM_MAILTO used for
  ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>I've enabled this option in .hyprc (the configuration file
  to which the pipe script for my archive points). Unlike the other
  options, this one does not create a link to
  mailto:admin@domain.com as I would expect. Any ideas?</em></p>
  <p>HM_MAILTO has a couple different uses. One is to trigger the
  insertion of the &lt;LINK REV=made HREF=mailto:...&gt; header in
  the HTML sources. This is most useable with ascii browsers such
  as lynx.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>hm_mailto = [ email-address | NONE ]<br />
    #<br />
    # The address of the contact point that is put in the HTML
    header line<br />
    # &lt;LINK REV=made HREF=mailto:hm_mailto&gt;<br />
    #<br />
    # The &lt;LINK...&gt; header can be disabled by default by
    setting<br />
    # mailto to NONE.</small></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>It can also be used in a hypermail page template file since it
  resolves to %m.</p>
  <p>For example, your footer file might look like...</p>
  <p><strong><small>&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;IMG
  SRC="/images/bar.png" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="4"
  ALT="---------"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;<br />
  &lt;ADDRESS&gt;<br />
  &lt;EM&gt;<br />
  &lt;SMALL&gt;<br />
  This archive was generated by %u on %g<br />
  &lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;<br />
  Send administrative comments to&lt;A
  HREF="mailto:%m"&gt;%m&lt;/A&gt;<br />
  &lt;/P&gt;<br />
  &lt;/SMALL&gt;<br />
  &lt;/EM&gt;<br />
  &lt;/ADDRESS&gt;<br />
  &lt;/BODY&gt;<br />
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</small></strong></p>
  <p>In this case the %m is expanded to admin@domain.com.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="10">10. Can I send a message to the
  list from the web archive ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>I would like to add a link to the menu that says "Send a
  Message to the List." I read through the documentation on your
  website, and I think I know what I have to do. However, I cannot
  find an example of what a .hyp template file should look
  like.</em></p>
  <p>That's what "Respond" on the menubar does. It allows a person
  to reply to the existing message, with the reply sent to the list
  address. And "mail a new topic" on the menubar allows a user to
  send a new message to the list.</p>
  <p>To enable this feature set</p>
  <p><strong><small><br />
  hm_hmail = listaddr@your-site.domain</small></strong></p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="11">Can I build and run this on
  Windows 98/2000/NT ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>I would like to use Hypermail on my Windows box. Can I ?
  If so how do I build the latest version ?</em></p>
  <p>There is a complete description on how to build hypermail on a
      Windows system at <a href=
			   "http://www.hypermail.org/win32.html">win32.html</a>. This was
      written by Bob Crispen &lt;bob.crispen@boeing.com&gt;. (Thanks
      Bob!)</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

      <h3><a href="#" id="12">How can I remove a listserver
  subject prefix ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>The Subject index page does not seem to do the right
  sorting. My list has a "subject prefix" so people can filter
  their inbound mail better. Is that confusing the sorting
  ?</em></p>
  <p>Yes. Hypermail functions that deal with replies look for the
  Re: and return a pointer to the subject line after the "Re: ".
  The listserver software is prefixing the subject line contents
  with [subject-prefix]. For example:</p>
  <p><strong><small>Initial message:<br /></small></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>Subject: [subject-prefix] the subject of the
    message</small></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong><small>Replies:<br /></small></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>Subject: [subject-prefix] Re: the subject of the
    message</small></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The best solution is to use the directive</p>
  <blockquote>
      <strong>stripsubject = [subject-prefix]</strong>
  </blockquote>in the config file for that list. Then
  [subject-prefix] is stripped before the Reply processing occurs
  and the proper things happen. This is the proper fix since
  hypermail would need to know to strip the [subject-prefix] from
  the initial messages to get it right.
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="13">Which configuration file should
  I use ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>Which configuration file should I use ?. Is it the
  hypermail.rc file in the Configs directory? I'm trying to edit
  the appearance of pages created by hypermail, but I think I'm
  trying to edit the wrong config file.</em></p>
  <p>With one of the later versions you can use the -v option to
  generate a config file that you can use. There is not just one
  config file. What are included are examples.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>$ hypermail -v &gt;
    some-file.rc</small></strong>
  </blockquote>Edit the some-file.rc and set the values to what you
  want.
  <p>Then run hypermail using the config file by:</p>
  <blockquote>
      <strong><small>$ hypermail -c some-file.rc.</small></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="14">Why is the downloaded file name
  different when I download hypermail.tar.gz ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>The source is available from</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    <em><a href=
    "http://www.hypermail-project.org/hypermail.tar.gz">www.hypermail.org/hypermail.tar.gz</a></em>
  </blockquote><em>However: When downloading though IE v4 browser
  on an NT PC, you get a file called hypermail_tar.tar.</em>
  <p>Depending on your browser MIME type setup and support
      applications, the filename downloaded might be hypermail.tar,
      hypermail.tar.gz, etc. In any case, you will be informed as to
      the filename when you actually download it onto a Windows/NT PC.
      Use that name from that point forward.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

      <h3><a href="#" id="15">Can I throttle hypermail's CPU
  usage ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>I'm looking for a good way to throttle hypermail. When it
  runs it is taking over both CPU's on my system. Is there a way to
  have it limit itself?</em></p>
  <p>There is currently no "nice" call in hypermail to limit
  itself. Maybe we can consider it in the future. You might run it
  as a subcommand to nice. For example in an aliases file:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <strong><small>"|nice someval 'hypermail command
    line'"</small></strong>
  </blockquote>I've NEVER tried this so... ;)
  <p>You might also be looking at a very large archive with lots of
  messages being the cause. If so then try breaking it up into
  smaller archives such as monthly archives. Tools are available
  for that in the latest release.</p>
  <p>And if the list is a high traffic list, consider not running
  it from a sendmail alias and instead, run it from cron. (To
  assure it does not run unnecessarily, consider using 'make' to
  check dependencies on the inbound mailbox and the archive itself.
  If the mailbox is newer, then run the hypermail command. If not,
  then no new message have been received so don't bother running
  it.</p>
  <p>If the you are using the linkquotes option and incremental
      update (-u option), add a searchbackmsgnum line to your config
      file. It controls the tradeoff between speed and the reliability
      of finding the right source for quoted text. Try to set it to the
      largest number of messages between a message and the final direct
      reply to that message.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="16">How can I make my archive
  searchable ?</a></h3>
  <p><em>Where can I find a program that provides an easy way of
  adding a "search this archive" feature to my hypermail
  archive?</em></p>
  <p>These seem to be the most popular choices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.htdig.org">Htdig</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://swish-e.org">Swish-E</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://webglimpse.org/">Glimpse</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.namazu.org/">Namazu</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://search.mnogo.ru/">mnoGoSearch</a></li>
  </ul>Swish-E comes with a script (index_hypermail.pl) that is
  customized for indexing Hypermail archives. <a href=
  "index_hypermail.txt">index_hypermail.txt</a> has a description
  of how to use it.
  <p>You can also use search engines by putting text such as this
  on your web page (although this search produces results from an
  entire site, not just the email archive):<br />
  &lt;form action=http://www.google.com/search&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=text name=as_q&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=hidden name=as_sitesearch
  value=hypermail-project.org&gt;<br />
  &lt;input type=submit value="Search Hypermail"&gt;<br />
  &lt;/form&gt;</p>
  <p>You can probably get more complete (but apparently not recent)
      info at: <a href=
		  "http://www.searchenginewatch.com/resources/software.html">Search
      Engine Software For Your Web Site</a>.</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="17">How does hypermail decide
  whether messages are in the same thread?</a></h3>
  <p>It uses the In-Reply-To: header if that is available. If not,
  it uses the References: header if that is available. If these are
  not available, it looks for previous messages with the same
  subject header. Matches based on the subject are listed as
  "maybe" replies.</p>
  <p>If the linkquotes option is used, it will also search the
      message bodies of the previous searchbackmsgnum (default = 500)
      messages for text that looks like it is being quoted in the
      current message. If it finds one or more prior messages with such
      text matches, it will treat the one with the longest match as the
      message being replied to. The exact algorithms for deciding what
      is quoted text are a bit complex. These matches override the
      In-Reply-To: and References: info (this rule may deserve further
      thought).</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="18">How can I have multiple
  mailboxes produce one archive?</a></h3>
  <p>One simple way is to combine them into one mailbox, and send
  that to hypermail. Something like<br /></p>
  <blockquote>
    "cat file1 file2 file3 &gt; combined"
  </blockquote>should do that.
  <p>Another way is to invoke hypermail several times, using the -u
  flag for any mailboxes that you want added after the html archive
  has been started:</p>
  <pre>
 hypermail -m file1
 hypermail -u -m file2
 hypermail -u -m file3
</pre>
<p>Do not try to send hypermail more than one mailbox at a time,
    or send it a second mailbox without using the -u flag or the
    increment=1 or increment=-1 option.</p>
<hr class="centered" />

<h3><a href="#" id="19">I have received an email with
  attachment that needs octet-stream. What should I do?</a></h3>
  <p>No attachment "needs" octet-stream. octet-stream is a label
  that describes the attachment as being "a stream of octets". What
  is that you say? Well, the application didn't know any more
  specifics and thus it identified it as good as possible. It knows
  it is a stream of octets, nothing else.</p>
  <p>So, an attachment coming as "octet-stream" can be pretty much
  ANYTHING. You have no idea, and neither does anyone else. The
  only way to figure out is to download the file and see for
  yourself, ask the person who mailed it or to hope that the mail
  it came with describes what the attachment was about.</p>
  <p>"octet-stream" could just as well be named "I haven't got the
      slightest idea what this is, but I know it is built up with a
      series of bytes".</p>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="20">Why is Hypermail ignoring some
  messages?</a></h3>
  <p>One possibility is that those messages have a header
  saying</p>
  <blockquote>
    X-No-Archive: yes
  </blockquote>which seems to indicate that the author doesn't want
  them included in any archive. This is controlled by a configure
  option which defaults to:
  <blockquote>
    deleted = "X-Hypermail-Deleted X-No-Archive"
  </blockquote>To get Hypermail to treat these as normal messages,
  add this to your config file (which is ~/.hmrc by default) or
  alter the "deleted" line in your existing config file to:
  <blockquote>
      deleted = "X-Hypermail-Deleted"
  </blockquote>
  <hr class="centered" />

  <h3><a href="#" id="21">Bogus dates are causing some
  emails to be put in a strange folder. Is there an easy way around
  this?</a></h3>
  <p>If the bad dates were caused by a computer with the date set
  absurdly, try running <a href=
  "http://gradha.sdf-eu.org/program/mailbox_date_trimmer.en.html">mailbox_date_trimmer.py</a>,
  available in the Hypermail's contrib directory.</p>
  <p>If the bad dates are in a format that Hypermail doesn't
      understand, then you will probably need to edit them
      manually.</p>
