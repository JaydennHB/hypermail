	    <h2><a id="1" href="#">What is Hypermail?</a></h2>
	    <strong>Hypermail</strong> is a program that takes a file of mail
	    messages in UNIX mailbox format and generates a set of
	    cross-referenced HTML documents. Each file that is created
	    represents a separate message in the mail archive and contains
	    links to other articles, so that the entire archive can be browsed
	    in a number of ways by following links. Archives generated by
	    Hypermail can be incrementally updated, and Hypermail is set by
	    default to only update archives when changes are detected.
	    <p>Each HTML file that is generated for a message contains (where
		applicable):</p>
	    <ul>
		<li>the subject of the article,</li>
		<li>the name and email address of the sender,</li>
		<li>the date the article was sent,</li>
		<li>links to the next and previous messages in the archive,</li>
		<li>a link to the message the article is in reply to, and</li>
		<li>a link to the message next in the current thread.</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>In addition, Hypermail will convert references in each message
		to email addresses and URLs to hyperlinks so they can be selected.
		Email addresses can be converted to <strong>mailto:</strong> URLs
		or links to a CGI mail program.</p>
	    <p>To complement each set of HTML messages, four index files are
		created which sort the articles by date received, thread, subject,
		and author. Each entry in these index files are links to the
		individual articles and provide a bird's-eye view of every archived
		message.</p>
	    <p>Hypermail was originally developed and designed by
		<a href="mailto:gruber@intraspect.com">Tom Gruber</a> for Enterprise
		Integration Technologies (EIT) in Common Lisp. It was later
		rewritten in C by <a href="mailto:kev@kevcom.com">Kevin Hughes</a>
		while at EIT. Hypermail is now being maintained by Peter McCluskey
		<a href="mailto:pcm@rahul.net">&lt;pcm@rahul.net&gt;</a>.</p>
	    <p>To see what Hypermail can do, take a look at these
		Hypermail-produced archives:</p>

<p>Using the flags <strong>-h</strong>, or <strong>-?</strong> with
Hypermail will display this usage summary.</p>

<h2><a id="3" href="#">Command-Line Options</a></h2>
<a id="3.1" href="#"><strong>Input and Output
Options:</strong><br /></a>
<blockquote><strong>-i</strong>,<br />
<strong>-m</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"mailbox"</em>,<br />
<strong>-d</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"directory"</em>,<br />
<strong>-c</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"file"</em></blockquote>
<p>To tell Hypermail what mailbox to read in, use the
<strong>-m</strong> option. If articles will be sent to Hypermail
through standard input, use the <strong>-i</strong> option. Note
that the <strong>-m</strong> and <strong>-i</strong> options can't
be used together! By default, Hypermail will look for a file called
<strong>mbox</strong> to read its articles in from.</p>
<p>The <strong>-d</strong> option specifies the directory to put
the HTML files and index files that are created into. If the
directory doesn't exist, a new one will be created with the name
that is specified. If the <strong>-d</strong> option isn't used,
Hypermail will look for a directory with the same name as the
mailbox or will create one if needed.</p>
<pre>
   example 1: hypermail -m "wu-ftpd" -d "/wu-ftpd"
   example 2: cat "/var/spool/mail/wu-ftpd" | hypermail -i
</pre>
<ol>
<li>This example reads the articles in <strong>wu-ftpd</strong> and
will save the output in the <strong>/wu-ftpd</strong>
directory.</li>
<li>This reads the file <strong>/var/spool/mail/wu-ftpd</strong>
from standard input and will save the output in a directory called
<strong>archive</strong> in the same directory Hypermail was run
from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that Hypermail can only read messages in the UNIX mailbox
format! Such archives are typically RFC 2822 mail messages appended
to each other that look similar to this:</p>
<pre>
   From john@foo.com  Mon Jan  1 00:01:30 1994
   Date: Mon, 1 Jan 1994 00:01:15 PDT
   From: john@foo.com
   To: everyone@foo.com
   Subject: Hello, world!

   Hi, everyone, just saying hello!

   From someone.else@foo.com  Mon Jan  1 00:02:00 1994
   Date: Mon, 1 Jan 1994 00:01:45 PDT
   ...
</pre>
<p>The messages are typically separated by lines in this
format:</p>
<pre>
   From wu-ftpd@wugate.wustl.edu  Fri Jul  1 00:18:20 1994
</pre>
<p>The <strong>-c</strong> option tells Hypermail to read in
settings from a <a href="hmrc.html">configuration file</a>. By
default, the program will attempt to read settings from a file
called <strong>.hmrc</strong> in the user's home directory if it
exists.</p>
<p>In the configuration file, variables are set in the following
manner:</p>
<blockquote><strong>variable = number<br />
variable = "string"</strong></blockquote>
The complete set of variables that Hypermail recognizes is
described in the <a href="hmrc.html">Configuration Options</a>
page.
<p><a id="3.2" href="#"><strong>Archive Interface
Options:</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><strong>-l</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"label"</em>,<br />
<strong>-b</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"About URL"</em>,<br />
<strong>-a</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Other Archives
URL"</em></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-l</strong> option tells Hypermail what to call the
archive - the name that is specified will be in the title of the
index pages so users know what sort of messages are being
archived.</p>
<p>The <strong>-a</strong> option includes a link labelled "Other
mail archives" in the index pages to any specified URL. This way
users who are looking at the archive have the opportunity to go to
pointers to other mail archives. By default, this will be a pointer
to the parent directory in which the archive files reside.</p>
<p>The <strong>-b</strong> option includes a link labelled "About
this archive" in the index pages to any specified URL. This way
users who are looking at the archive have the opportunity to go to
information about the archive.</p>
<pre>
   example: hypermail -l "WU-FTPD Development Archives"
            -a "http://www.landfield.com/wu-ftpd/"
            -b "http://www.landfield.com/wu-ftpd/mail-archive/"
</pre>
<p>In the index files for the archive, the above setting will
produce something like this:</p>
<blockquote><strong>(top of page)</strong>
<p><strong>WU-FTPD Archives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://landfield.com/wu-ftpd/"><strong>About this
archive</strong></a></li>
<li><a href=
"http://landfield.com/wu-ftpd/mail-archive/"><strong>Other mail
archives</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(list of indexed articles below)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a id="3.3" href="#"><strong>Updating
Options:</strong><br /></a></p>
<blockquote><strong>-x</strong>,<br />
<strong>-u</strong></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-x</strong> option tells Hypermail to explicitly
overwrite any previous HTML files that may exist. Use this option
only when it is desirable to completely rewrite the entire
archive.</p>
<p>The <strong>-u</strong> option tells Hypermail to add message(s)
to the end of the existing HTML file archive and integrate them
into it by links and cross-references. All archive index files will
be regenerated to include the new message.</p>
<p>Hypermail used to require that you only send it one message at a
time when using the <strong>-u</strong> option, but it should now
work reasonably when given mailboxes containing multiple
messages.</p>
<p>When using the <strong>-u</strong> option, don't send any
messages that Hypermail has already processed. If you want
Hypermail to recognize that some messages are old messages that
shouldn't be added to the archive again, send it a mailbox with a
complete set of messages and avoid the <strong>-u</strong>
option.</p>
<pre>
   example 1: cat "one.letter" | hypermail -i -u -d "/wu-ftpd/mail-archives"
   example 2: hypermail -u -m "one.letter" -d "/wu-ftpd/mail-archives"
   example 3: hypermail -m "mailbox" -d "/wu-ftpd/mail-archives" -x
   example 4: hypermail -m "mailbox" -d "/wu-ftpd/mail-archives"
</pre>
<ol>
<li>This tells Hypermail to take the article it receives from
standard input and integrate it with the archive under the
<strong>wu-ftpd/mail-archives</strong> directory. If no archive
exists, a new one will be created with the specified letter as the
first file of the archive.</li>
<li>This does the same thing, except that the letter is read in
from a file that contains only that letter.</li>
<li>With these options, Hypermail will read in the articles from
<strong>mailbox</strong> and write over any existing files in the
<strong>wu-ftpd/mail-archives</strong> directory if they exist. If
no archive exists, a new one will be created.</li>
<li>With these options, Hypermail will read in the articles from
<strong>mailbox</strong> and only write new articles - it will not
overwrite any existing archive files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that no matter what options are specified, the index files
are always rewritten. The date when Hypermail was last run is
included in index pages, so it's easy to tell when the archive was
last updated.</p>
<p><a id="3.4" href="#"><strong>Miscellaneous
Options</strong><br /></a></p>
<blockquote><strong>-p</strong><br />
<strong>-v</strong><br />
<strong>-V</strong></blockquote>
<p>The <strong>-p</strong> option shows a progress report as
Hypermail reads in and writes out messages - the number of files
that Hypermail is reading and writing and the file names of the
directory and files created are shown. This information is written
to standard output.</p>
<p>The <strong>-v</strong> option shows the configuration variables
and their values that Hypermail would use if it was run with the
same <a href="hmrc.html">configuration file</a> and command line
options. This is useful when starting up a new list or modifying a
list configuration file. Once the information is displayed,
Hypermail terminates and no actual processing occurs.</p>
<p>The <strong>-V</strong> option prints the Hypermail version
information. Once the information is displayed, Hypermail
terminates and not actual processing occurs.</p>
<p>The <strong>-0</strong> option list message numbers that should
be deleted from the html archive. The mbox is not changed. It is
equivalent to the <a href=
"hmrc.html#delete_msgnum">delete_msgnum</a> option.</p>
<hr />
<h2><a id="4" href="#">Configuration Options</a></h2>
Hypermail has many variables that can be set as environment
variables or as variables in the specified <a href=
"hmrc.html">configuration file</a>. For instance, using the C
shell, one could define variables in this manner:
<pre>
   setenv HM_MBOX /home/john/my_mailbox
   setenv HM_FILEMODE 0600
</pre>
<p>In the configuration file, variables must be in lowercase and
separated by their values with an equals (<strong>=</strong>) sign.
Blank lines and lines beginning with the <strong>#</strong>
character are skipped:</p>
<pre>
   mbox = "/home/john/my_mailbox"
   filemode = 0600
</pre>
While the example uses quotes (<strong>"</strong>), they is not
required when used in the configuration file.
<p>Below is a list of the more important configuration variables.
For a complete list, see <a href="hmrc.html">hmrc.html</a>.</p>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>HM_LABEL "label name"</strong></dt>
    <dd>Define this as the default label to put in archives.</dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_ARCHIVES "URL"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This will create a link in the archived index pages to the
	specified URL. Define as <strong>"NONE"</strong> to omit such a
	link. See also <a href=
			  "hmrc.html#custom_archives">custom_archives</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_HMAIL "list submission address"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the email address used to send a new message to a
	hypermail archive. "NONE" means don't use it. Since this is
	different for each hypermail archive, you should probably leave it
	set to "NONE" here, and let it be specified at runtime by
	command-line parameters in the list specific configfile.<br />
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#newmsg_command">newmsg_command</a> and
	<a href="hmrc.html#replymsg_command">replymsg_command</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_DIR "directory"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the default directory that Hypermail will look for when
	creating and updating archives. If defined as
	<strong>"NONE"</strong>, the directory name will be the same name
	as the mailbox read in.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_MBOX "filename"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the default mailbox to read messages in from. Define
	this with a value of <strong>"NONE"</strong> to read from standard
	input as the default.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_STRIPSUBJECT "text"</strong></dt>
    <dd>A string to be stripped from all subject lines. Helps unclutter
	mailing lists which add tags to subject lines.
    </dd>

    <dt id="folder_by_date"><strong>HM_FOLDER_BY_DATE ="strftime-date-format"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This string causes the messages to be put in subdirectories by
	date. The string will be passed to strftime(3) to generate
	subdirectory names based on message dates. Suggested values are
	"%y%m" or "%b%y" for monthly subdirectories, "%Y" for yearly,
	"%G/%V" for weekly. Do not alter this for an existing archive
	without removing the old html files. If you use this and update the
	archive incrementally (e.g. with -u), you must use the 
	<a href="hmrc.html#usegdbm">usegdbm</a> option.<br />
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#monthly_index">monthly_index</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt id="isodate"><strong>HM_ISODATE boolean_number</strong></dt>
    <dd>Set this to On to display article received dates in YYYY-MM-DD
	HH:MM:SS format. If used with the 
	<a href="hmrc.html#gmtime">gmtime</a> option, a Z will be inserted between
	the DD and HH.<br />
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#eurodate">eurodate</a> and 
	<a href="hmrc.html#dateformat">dateformat</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_LANGUAGE "language-id"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is a two-letter string specifying the default language to
	use, or a longer string specifying a language and locale. Set this
	the value of the language table you wish to use when running and
	generating archives. See also <a href=
					 "hmrc.html#iso2022jp">iso2022jp</a> and <a href=
										    "hmrc.html#eurodate">eurodate</a>.<br />
	<br />
	Current supported languages, with their default locales:
	<blockquote>
	    de (de_DE) - German<br />
	    en (en_US) - English<br />
	    es (es_ES) - Spanish<br />
	    fi (fi_FI) - Finnish<br />
	    fr (fr_FR) - French<br />
	    el (el) - Greek<br />
	    gr (el_GR) - Greek<br />
	    is (is_IS) - Icelandic<br />
	    no (no_NO) - Norwegian<br />
	    pl (pl_PL) - Polish<br />
	    pt (pt_BR) - Brazilian Portuguese<br />
	    ru (ru_RU) - Russian<br />
	    sv (sv_SE) - Swedish
	</blockquote>
	The directory /usr/share/i18n/locales on many systems has the
	locale codes that are available on that system.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_INCREMENT -1, 0, or 1</strong><br /></dt>
    <dd>Define as <strong>1</strong> to append all input messages to the
	end of existing archives.<br />
	Define as <strong>0</strong> for it to read a mailbox that
	corresponds to the entire archive. If there are any existing html
	messages, it will figure out which ones at the end of the mailbox
	are new, and add only those that haven't been converted yet.<br />
	Define as <strong>-1</strong> to have hypermail figure out whether
	the input is entirely new messages to be appended or whether it
	contains messages that are already in the archive. A value of -1
	cannot be used with the mbox_shortened option or with the -i
	command line option or with mbox = NONE.<br />
	<br />
    </dd>

    <dt id="append"><strong>HM_APPEND boolean_number</strong></dt>
    <dd>Set this to On to maintain a parallel mbox archive. The file
	name defaults to mbox in the directory specified by -d or
	dir.<br />
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#append_filename">append_filename</a>
	and <a href="hmrc.html#txtsuffix">txtsuffix</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_SHOWHTML 0, 1, or 2</strong></dt>

    <dd>Define as <strong>1</strong> to show the articles in a
	proportionally-spaced font rather than a fixed-width
	(monospace) font. Setting this option to 1 also tells
	Hypermail to attempt to italicize quoted passages in articles.
	<p>Define as <strong>2</strong> for more complex conversion to html
	    similar to that in 
	    <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~seth/txt2html/">txt2html.pl</a>. Showhtml
	    = 2 will normally produce nicer looking results than showhtml = 1,
	    and showhtml = 0 will look pretty dull, but 1 and 2 run risks of
	    altering the appearance in undesired ways.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_LINKQUOTES boolean_number</strong></dt>
    <dd>Set this to On to create fine-grained links from quoted text to
	the text where the quote originated. It also improves the threads
	index file by more accurately matching messages with replies. Note
	that this may be rather cpu intensive (see the 
	<a href="hmrc.html#searchbackmsgnum">searchbackmsgnum</a> option to alter
	the performance).
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_ABOUT "URL"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This will create a link in the archived index pages to the
	specified URL. Define as <strong>"NONE"</strong> to omit such a link.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_MAILTO address</strong></dt>
    <dd>The address of the contact point that is put in the HTML header
	line
	<blockquote>
	    <code><strong>&lt;LINK REV=made HREF=mailto:MAILTO&gt;</strong></code>
	</blockquote>
	The <code>&lt;LINK...&gt;</code> header can be disabled by default by setting
	<code>HM_MAILTO</code> to "<code>NONE</code>".
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_FILTER_OUT expression</strong></dt>
    <dd> Delete messages with
	headers matching regular expressions 
	(<a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</a> syntax).
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#filter_require">filter_require</a>,
	<a href="hmrc.html#filter_out_full_body">filter_out_full_body</a>, 
	and <a 
		href="hmrc.html#filter_require_full_body">filter_require_full_body</a>.<br />
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_DOMAINADDR "domainname"</strong></dt>
    <dd>Set this to the domainname you want added to a mail address
	appearing in the RFC2822 field which lack a hostname. When the list
	resides on the same host as the user sending the message, it is
	often not required of the MTA to domain-ize these addresses for
	delivery. In such cases, Hypermail will add the DOMAINADDR to the
	email address. If defined as NONE, this feature is turned off.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_USEMETA [ 0 | 1 ]</strong></dt>
    <dd>This option allows you to use metadata to store the content
	type of a MIME attachments and, later on, when a user browses the
	attachment, send back this information in the HTTP Content-Type
	header. When set to <strong>1</strong>, the Content-Type header of
	a MIME attachment will be stored in a metadata file. Let us say
	that the MIME attachments for a message are stored in directory
	<strong>att-num</strong>. The metadata for those attachments will
	then be stored in directory <strong>att-num/.meta</strong>. If a
	MIME attachment is stored in file <strong>att-file</strong>, its
	metadata will be stored in file <strong>att-file.meta</strong>.
	This convention is directly compatible with the Apache server
	handling of metadata.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_REVERSE boolean_number</strong></dt>
    <dd>Defining this variable as <strong>1</strong> will reverse-sort
	the article entries in the date and thread index files by the date
	they were received. That is, the most recent messages will appear
	at the top of the index rather than the other way around.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_MHTMLHEADERFILE "path"</strong></dt>
    <dd>Define path as the path to a file containing valid HTML
	formatting statements that you wish to included at the top of every
	message page. Hypermail will print this file as the header of the
	message so make sure it contains <strong>&lt;HTML&gt;,
	&lt;HEAD&gt;, and &lt;BODY&gt;</strong> and other statements that
	suit your local customized needs.<br />
	See also <a href="hmrc.html#ihtmlheaderfile">ihtmlheaderfile</a>,
	<a href="hmrc.html#ihtmlfooterfile">ihtmlfooterfile</a>, and
	<a href="hmrc.html#mhtmlfooterfile">mhtmlfooterfile</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>HM_CONFIGFILE "filename"</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the default configuration file to read settings in
	from. This can only be specified as an environment variable. If the
	first character is "~", Hypermail will look for the file under the
	current user's home directory.

or standard input. Filenames start at zero and increase in this
fashion: <strong>0000.html, 0001.html, 0002.html</strong>, etc. In
the same directory:
<ul>
<li><strong>date.html</strong> is the index of articles sorted by
the date they were received by the system's mail daemon.</li>
<li><strong>thread.html</strong> is the index of articles sorted by
thread first, then the date they were received.</li>
<li><strong>subject.html</strong> is the index of articles sorted
by subject. Any "Re:" prefixes in front of subjects will have been
stripped out.</li>
<li><strong>author.html</strong> is the index of articles sorted by
the first word of the author's name. If the author's name can't be
determined, their email address will be substituted.</li>
<li>One of the above files will be called
<strong>index.html</strong> and is the default index that users can
go to when entering the archive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sorting:</strong> In the date and thread index files,
note that these lists are sorted by the date the articles were
received by the system's mail daemon, not by the date they were
written on. The order of articles in the date index may not
necessarily match the order in which the article files are written
and linked together. Because of this, it is a good idea to make
sure the mailbox is sorted by date with the most recent messages
towards the bottom.</p>
<p><a id="6b"></a> <strong>Running Hypermail
automatically:</strong> All that's needed to start archiving email
messages is to set up Hypermail to do incremental updates in your
<strong>/etc/aliases</strong> file (assuming that you use
<strong>sendmail</strong> or something that works like it to
deliver mail). Here's what an entry might look like (the last line
is one unbroken line):</p>
<blockquote><strong>#<br />
# WU-FTPD Mailing List Archives<br />
#<br />
wulist: "|/usr/local/bin/hypermail -i -u -d /wu-ftpd/mail-archive
-l \"WU-FTPD Mailing List Archive\""</strong></blockquote>
After adding the entry, make sure <strong>newaliases</strong> is
run to update the mail aliases. This entry will run Hypermail and
update/create the archive whenever a new message is received.
Hypermail also works well as a <strong>cron</strong> job. Because
<strong>sendmail</strong> may run Hypermail as different users, you
will want to make sure that archive directories and files are made
readable and writeable by a trusted sendmail user (or read/writable
by everyone if you can't do that) when they are created. This will
ensure that there will be no problems incrementally updating the
archive.
<p>If you use qmail instead of sendmail, you probably want to
create a file /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-&lt;mylistemailaddress&gt;
containing something like this:</p>
<blockquote>|/usr/local/bin/hypermail -i -u -d
/wu-ftpd/mail-archive -l \"WU-FTPD Mailing List
Archive\"</blockquote>
<p>If you are running Linux kernel version 2.4 or higher, <a href=
"http://www.student.lu.se/~nbi98oli/dnotify.html">dnotify</a> looks
like it provides another way to automate Hypermail.</p>
<p><strong>Including HTML in messages:</strong> One can include
formatted HTML in message bodies by enclosing the HTML with the
&lt;HTML&gt; tag (in either uppercase or lowercase). This tag must
be on a line by itself:</p>
<pre>
   This text will not be parsed...
   &lt;html&gt;
   <strong>this text</strong> will be parsed as HTML.
   &lt;/html&gt;
   This text will not be parsed...
</pre>
<p>There is no limit to how often the &lt;HTML&gt; tag can be used
in an article.</p>
